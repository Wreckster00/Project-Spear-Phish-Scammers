# Project-Spear-Phish-Scammers
Project Spear Phish Scammers is a web application designed to precisely pin-point the GPS location of the scammers. It can also reveal their residential location, using social engineering tactics.

For a tutorial on how to use this web app, I would strongly encourage you to read the full documentation of the project .

Disclaimer: This web app is merely a social engineering tool to ease the process of finding out a fraudsterâ€™s location and it does NOT substitute criminal investigation. If you are facing any serious consequence of a fraudulent act, you must report the incident to your local police department. Do not use this for illegal purposes.

For bug reports, please open an [issue here](https://github.com/Wreckster00/Project-Spear-Phish-Scammers/issues).
