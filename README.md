# Project-Spear-Phish-Scammers
Project Spear Phish Scammers is a web application designed to precisely pinpoint the GPS location of the scammers. It can also reveal their residential location, using social engineering tactics.

This web app is a basic template and contains explicit content. To get started, it is recommended to tailor its contents according to your ideology.
For a tutorial on how to use this web app, I would strongly encourage you to read the full documentation of the project here.

**Disclaimer: This web app is merely a social engineering tool to ease the process of finding out a fraudsterâ€™s location and it does NOT substitute criminal investigation. If you are facing any serious consequence of a fraudulent act, you must report the incident to your local police department. Do not use this for illegal purposes.**
